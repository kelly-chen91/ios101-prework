## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A challenge I faced while building the app is changing the text color. According to the tutorials I have seen online, it seems like I need to create a new struct, but in the end I was able to figure that I can do the same way I did with dragging the element over and change the text color that way. 

Another challege I faced was navigating through XCode as it is a new IDE that I am working with.
